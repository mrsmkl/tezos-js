# tezos-js
Tezos Michaelson interpreter compiled to js.

Just removed the dependencies that were problematic, so many things will not work properly yet,
for example cannot have multiple contracts, and at least none of the cryptography related things will work.

TODO:
 * Better command-line tool for node.js
 * Check that zarith wrapper works
 * ACE or Codemirror editor
 * Error reporting integrated into the editor
 * Make more stubs so the original files can be used directly
 * Cryptographic primitives
